The main goal of the majority of my code is to create seven variables for the numbers I need to output for the user. I did this by
breaking my program into five parts. Part one asks for inputs from the user so that the program can use them for parts and three.
Parts two and three take the inputs of the user for distance and gas, converts them to the unselected measurement, and makes the 
conversions into variables for later. Part four takes the variables the program has created so far and puts them into corresponding
functions to create a fuel consumption. Part five takes fuel consumption and gives it a rating using a series of if and elif statements.
Finally, all variables are outputed to the user in the requested format.
